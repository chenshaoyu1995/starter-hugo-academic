I am a PhD student in Computer Science at New York University Tandon School of Engineering, supervised by [Prof. Claudio T. Silva](https://ctsilva.github.io/). And I am a member in [NYU Visualization and Data Analytics (VIDA) Research Center](https://vida.engineering.nyu.edu/). My research interests include virtual/augmented reality, data visualization.

I received my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. I was a recipient of [Academic Achievement Medal](https://registry.hkust.edu.hk/academic-achievement-medal). It is the highest academic honor bestowed by the university and only about the top 1% of the graduates will be awarded. I was a member in [HKUST VisLab](http://vis.cse.ust.hk/index.html), advised by [Prof. Huamin Qu](http://huamin.org/). I am an Affiliated High School of South China Normal University alumnus.
